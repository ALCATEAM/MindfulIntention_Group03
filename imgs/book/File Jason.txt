	<p>A common perception of philosophers is of the wizened old guru, sitting on a mountain top contemplating his navel; or worse, a stodgy, boring intellectual that everyone avoids at parties. But philosophy, at its best, is a joyous profession. Philosophers never stop wondering, why? They ask the most profound and universal questions: “Why am I here?” “Does life have a meaning?” “Is there a God?” “Do I have an immortal soul?” “What happens when I die?” Philosophers have the joy of re-living the wonder of a child. </p>

	<p>Since 1992 I’ve been promoting gardening as a fitness lifestyle. While others have written about gardening as exercise. I rarely see anything new or even remotely similar to the concepts and techniques in this book. To be clear, I am recommending major changes to how you currently garden; I am not just saying “hey, gardening is good exercise.” This book will change how you think and perform every garden motion. My first book, Fitness the Dynamic Gardening Way, extolled the virtues of moderate exercise, sound nutrition, and psychological well-being. It was revolutionary and far-reaching. My second book, Get Fit Through Gardening, was published in 2008 by Hatherleigh Press. It focused more on the specific and unique motions and techniques I’ve developed over the years. </p>

	<p>This book, Aerobic Gardening, is a short distillation of the forty key concepts that transform traditional gardening into Aerobic Gardening. I’ve added concepts and techniques from the martial arts, aerobics, strength training, and other disciplines I’ve created something totally new. Call it Aerobic Gardening, Power Gardening, Fitness Gardening, or Dynamic Gardening. You are now gardening to exercise and exercising to garden. They are one. The more time, effort, and dedication you invest the greater the rewards. </p>

	<p>After you’ve read through all forty concepts, don’t feel like you have to do all of them all of the time. Sometimes you just want to enjoy the garden and not work up a sweat. But, Aerobic Gardening can now become another tool in your fitness arsenal. It’s not all or nothing; no one is keeping score; you compete only with yourself. Have fun with it. At the very least, buying new tools, adopting my techniques, and focusing on your body will help you be less sore the next day after a few hours in the garden. Tell me your story. Let’s share this with the world. </p>`,

When you are trying to burn belly fat combining aerobic step exercise with your favorite ab workout makes a great circuit training routine.</p>

	<p>This practice is closely related to "mindfulness," which Professor Muesse defines as "a deliberate way of paying attention to what is occurring within oneself as it is happening. It is the process of attentively observing your experience as it unfolds, without judgment or evaluation." </p>

	<p>"Meditation," he adds, "refers to certain exercises that can be used to enlarge and refine mindfulness." Meditation cultivates mindfulness by training you to develop deep attention to the present moment, allowing the mind to become settled and centered. These 24 detailed lectures teach you the principles and techniques of sitting meditation, the related practice of walking meditation, and the highly beneficial use of meditative awareness in many important activities, including eating and driving. You will also learn how to use the skills of meditation in working with thoughts and emotional states, in deepening sensory awareness of the body, and in becoming deeply attentive to the operation of your mind. </p>

	<p>You'll come away with a solid basis for your own meditation practice and for bringing meditation's remarkable and empowering benefits to every aspect of your life. </p>`,
